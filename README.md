# Mobile Robot Navigation Using Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)
The repository provides two main functions: training a TD3 model for mobile robot navigation in the Gazebo simulation and implementing the model in a real-world environment using Robotino 4. This work is the result of my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis in Robotics and AI Engineering at Airlangga University.
